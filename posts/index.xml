      <description>These are some anecdotes I thought worth sharing, they were jotted down throughout my first year as a software engineer @Shopify.
Take things slow Pull requests are there for a reason, when you start on a feature, don&amp;rsquo;t let yourself stray from the initial goal you started when you got to work that morning.
I was forced to learn to this out of necessity; it was hard enough to get single line changes merged with the standard of quality enforced by my team, if I was going to get any work accomplished I realized I would have to greatly reduce the scope of my pull requests.</description>
